## General View of Digital Economy

The term Digital Economy was coined in Don Tapscott’s 1995 best seller “The Digital Economy” which showed how the Internet would change the way we did business. It can be understood as the economic activity that results from billions of everyday online connections among people, business, etcetera where the growing of interconnection between these are the backbone of the Digital Economy. 

Over the time, different events have occurred in history that have changed the way of seeing or doing things, events such as economic crises, natural disasters, and more to said something which have made people, institutions and even governments leave their comfort zone and face economic activities in a different way, which has given rise and development to the digital economy.

Since the onset of the Industrial revolution, there have been 5 major technology-driven economic cycles that were the ones developing the digital economy. First was the age of machines, factories and canals. This was followed by the age of steam, railways, iron and coal. The next were the steel, electricity and heavy engineering. Following them were the oil, automobiles, and mass productions. Last our present ICT-based digital state starting in 1971.

Digital Economy plays an important role when we analyze the perspective of economic crises because it affects economies and societies in complex and interrelated ways, demanding more strategic approaches.

The information technology can be used to contribute to the productivity and growth through technological progress, it can be used to improve the productivity and generate cost reduction via automation and standardization of back – and front-office activities.

In addition, it can be used to improve efficiency in the aspects of sales and operations, customer service and logistic processes and procedures. It also allows to increase productivity, improve customer relationships, contribute to GDP growth, create new services and industries and business innovation.

An actual example is the case of the country of Venezuela, as it is known has gone through many problems until get into an economic crisis that leaded them to adopt the use of Dollar. The bolivars have a very low depression, and to give an idea, one dollar is equal to 4,030,632.81 Venezuelan bolivars and therefore dealing with something more expensive would not fit their wallet. 

In order to deal with this, the “PagoClave” was developed to deal with it and allow them to receive and make interbank payments that can help them to have more profits.
In fact, digital Economy is not limited to only that, other examples are the effects into the financial sectors (globalizations of financial markets, innovation in the financial sectors etc), the use in money innovation (Electronic money or Digital money) among others.

However, all of that was not like now, before of what we know as Digital Economy, there existed their prior or first existences which are present below.

Industry 1.0: Popularly known as the first industrial revolution in the middle of the 18th century, starting in Great Britain and then spreading to Western Europe and finally to North America. This first revolution was a milestone for rural areas and mechanization, since the economy began to depend on mechanized industries in its processes such as textile, transportation and energy.

Industry 2.0: The second industrial revolution began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, and it was given that there were political and military conflicts in the world (First World War). In fact, capitalism was consolidated as the main economic model. But in general, this revolution is given by electricity and oil as new forms of energy, for example steam was replaced by electricity and the use of oil for combustion engines. so, it would allow the mechanization of new industrial processes and gave way to the increase of labor.

Industry 3.0: Around the middle of the 20th century, industry 3.0 began to emerge, bringing with it the emergence of telecommunications, electronics, the creation of computers and the development of information systems, which opened the doors to space expeditions and biotechnology. On the industrial side, programmable logic controllers (PLC) and robots were created, allowing the automation of processes.

Industry 4.0: The industry we are currently going through is the 4.0, which changes the paradigm, since it is characterized by what we all currently use "the internet", so industrial machines are equipped with digital tools connected to the internet that generate data, creating important information for decision making. In general, this fourth industry is marked by digital platforms, hyper-automation, robotics, AI, 3D printing, ML, nanotechnology and IoT.

But is that the end of the Digital Economy and Industry innovations? The answer is no.

Digital Economy is something that will never stop to change over the time, as we mentioned before, the next revolution in production, or in a general way, would be the industry 5.0, and the term popped up several years ago as a reaction to the vision of Industry 4.0. 
Industry 5.0 refers in this case and context to people working alongside robots and smart machines. It focuses into the robot helping humans work better and faster. 
This next revolution needs to define the way that we collaborate and how we define the rules between human and machine interaction. 
This next revolution is aimed at supporting not superseding human, which doesn’t mean the upsurge as an opportunity to eliminate headcount and replace workers who perform repetitive tasks on assembly lines, and it includes to find the optimal balance of efficiency and productivity.
Last, we can also see that the next production revolution is occurring through because of confluence of technologies from a large variety of digital technologies. As these technologies transform production, they will have far-reaching consequences for productivity, employment, skills, income distribution, trade, well-being and the environment.

### Questions 

1.- Do you think that wars, pandemics or similar events are necessary for the development of the digital economy? And why?  The answer may vary, but it should be focused on the fact that it is not entirely necessary for some global event to happen for the digital economy to grow, since Industry 4.0 does not have some event that has made it start, but as we have seen, the pandemic of covid-19 has made the digital economy grow. 

2.- Do you consider that the laws of the countries affect the development of the digital economy? The laws of the countries can affect that there is no growth in the digital economy, for example in Egypt is not allowed calls and video calls by WhatsApp and in Turkey pages like Wikipedia, Twitter and Facebook have problems due to the laws of the country.

3.- Do you think that at some point the development of technology or digital transformation will put human beings out of work? Well, the development of technology will make jobs disappear or become automated, however that does not mean that humans will become unemployed as new jobs and opportunities will be created for humans.

4.- Do you think it is correct that there are countries with a less developed digital economy? And why? The answer may vary, but in general it is not correct or appropriate that there are countries with no digital development, of course this depends on government and economic issues, which are complex. Because perhaps for now one of the priorities in a country is the health sector.

5.- Do you think that at some point technology will make us lazier?
We believe that this depends on people, for example home automation or having a smart home may make some activities lazier as time goes by. But other technological developments where it is necessary to have some course, diploma, or certificate to carry it out can make us not to be lazy, we would say that as well as for some activities will make us be lazy in others may not.

6.- Which UPY career do you think can boost the digital economy more, and why?
In our perspective data engineering in the short term can help develop or drive more of the digital economy, however in the long-term robotics and embedded systems can drive more of the digital economy.

7.- What was the first industrial revolution and what happened?
The first industrial revolution or industry 1.0 was about the automation of some industrial processes, allowing the rural sector to be left aside. Some examples of developments and advances of this first revolution are the printing press and energy.
8.- Do you consider that digital transformation may affect some people?
In our point of view it can definitely affect people who do not like to go out of their comfort zone or who do not like to keep up to date, but in general we believe that those who can be most affected are senior citizens.

9.- What disadvantages do you consider that digital transformation brings?
This answer may vary, but in general digital transformation can affect jobs that can be automated, for example supers’ cashiers, but leaving aside this issue, it can bring security issues or our personal data, such as identity theft or sensitive and compromising information about us.

10.- What are the skills that will make digital transformation work for everyone?
Soft skills.

11. Which were the 5 major technology-driven economic cycles that affected the development of the digital economy and in which years occurred?
First was the age of machines, factories and canals starting in 1771.  This was followed by the age of steam, railways, iron and coal, starting in 1829; steel, electricity and heavy engineering in 1875; oil, automobiles, and mass production in 1908; and our present ICT-based digital age starting in 1971.

12. Which are the two economic cycles that composed the two periods of the first phases of the Digital Economy? 
The installation period is the time of creative destruction, when new technologies emerge from the labs into the marketplace, entrepreneurs start many new businesses based on the new technologies, VCs encourage business model experimentation, and the new ventures attract considerable investments and financial speculation
The deployment period is a time of economic transformation and institutional recompositing.

13. Why data is emerging as a vital resource? 
It is because data are a driver of economic activity and a general-purpose input into production in many contexts, but the benefits are predicated on data availability and accessibility. 

14. Why are communication infrastructures and services policies so crucial in the digital economy? 
This is because they can be useful to foster high-speed infrastructure deployment, when these restrictions exist, they become in a barrier to investment, and if they are removed can allow the investment in infrastructure.

15. Why the policy markets need to boost competition in communications infrastructures and services markets to spur private investment and help to deploy fiber further into fixed networks?
This can support increases in speed and capacity across all next-generation technologies, including 5G networks, it can also influence in investment and pricing decision, or drive up the quality and speed of broadband etcetera. 

16. Why are the regional development policies so important for Digital Economy? 
They are important to address digital divides, namely differences in access to broadband in urban, semi-urban, rural and remote areas. This in fact includes how to solve critical bottlenecks in rural areas.

17. Why is important to harnessing the power and potential of digital technologies?
This is because, the effective use enables individual to participate in society, boos productivity. It also awareness the opportunities in business dynamism, investment in ICTs.

18. Which are the advantages and disadvantages of Digital Government strategies?
When we talk about the digital government strategies, they help to ensure a more comprehensive approach to digital transformation in two sections, the government and the public sector. However, in the case of large cross-country the changes and variations persist. Due this fact, the full advantages are not used at all, and remains, and needs form a more comprehensive digital government approach. 

19.  What is needed to increase the potential of digital tools, including in that the productivity?
It depends in a successful diffusion, however, this successful diffusion depends itself on firms’ investment, including ICTs, as well as public investment in infrastructure and equipment. It also requires the use of complementary assets, knowledge-based capital, data, organizational capital and skills.

20. What does depend on the business dynamism in, and which are the benefits? 
It depends on efficient resource allocation, experimentation and learning. It can benefit from structural reforms, in addition it can affect competitive pressure, turn technology diffusion and better resource allocation, including improving labour market regulations, employment protection and more.
